;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a minor mode to turn an org file into an
;; interactive music library. Pulls song from Youtube by default
;; (using youtube-dl) or from your Nextcloud when specified. Get
;; syncing, versioning, tagging, sharing, semantic, full text search
;; and more straight out of the box. It's plain-text after all!
